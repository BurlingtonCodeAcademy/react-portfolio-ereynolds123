        The six week postpartum period is a special time for mom and baby
        recognized world wide as a time for mom and baby to connect. Midwifery
        care differs from the mainstream medical model in the emphasis on
        quality clinical and emotional care after birth. Whereas most
        obstetricians do one appointment six weeks postpartum, most midwives
        have 4-6 appointments with their client postpartum to ensure the health
        and well being of mom and baby. There are so many concerns that can come
        up immediately after having a baby: breastfeeding concerns, mastitis,
        postpartum depression that are not being met by the traditional medical
        model. Here at In Our Hearts Midwifery, I hope to fill a void for women
        seeking more care on the other side of birth. We recognize that moms
        who’ve had C-sections need extra care to return to health and we strive
        to provide quality care to both mamas who’ve had C-sections or vaginal
        deliveries. At In Our Hearts, we recognize that at this stage, you and
        your baby are a unit; when you do well so does your baby and vice versa.
        It is my job to support you in building this mom-baby unit so that you
        have a truly excellent postpartum experience.

      <p>I believe: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>All women and childbearing families* deserve access to quality midwifery
        care and obstetrical care when required.</li> <li>Midwives should be the primary
        care providers for women in their reproductive years.</li> 
        <li>Midwifery education should be accessible to ALL people who desire to serve women
        and childbearing families* as a midwife. </li>
        <li>Midwives have a right to be
        autonomous practitioners. All criminilization of midwives and the
        clients we serve must end.</li>
        <p>*women and childbearing families is language
        used to include people who do not identify as women such as queer and
        trans* folk to the population of people that midwives serve.</p>

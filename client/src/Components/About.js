        <h1> About Me</h1>
        <p>
        I am a passionate birth doula. I have been through many roles in the birth world including childbirth educator, midwife and doula. Due to personal concerns, I have decided that being a doula at UVM allows me the greatest work life balance and the ability to reach clients who may not get a chance to have the doula/midwifery model of care for their births. 
        </p>

        I have experienced over a 100 different births in these various roles and have thoroughly enjoyed being able to participate in births and witness the intense joy (and sometimes sadness) that comes along with births. I love being able to help a new parent breathe through contractions, listen to their bodies when to push and to welcome the new baby into their arms lovingly. That first breath is truly a miracle.

        My experience began in El Paso. I went to Maternidad La Luz, a MEAC accredited midwifery school, to obtain my CPM. I obtained my CPM in 2017 and went on to become a Licenced midwife in Texas. I moved to Houston to continue my career as a midwife. I then moved on to be a doula for a doula practice in Houston.

        I eventually moved home to Vermont, and have begun to practice again at UVMMC. I took a doula training through UVMMC that specifically focused on birth center doulaing which greatly increased my scope. I hope to continue learning with childbearing families and working with a diverse client set who may not have had access to homebirth midwifery.
